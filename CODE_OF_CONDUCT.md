#Be nice.

Don't complain.

Don't argue.

Don't start flame wars.

Don't dramatize.

Comment excessively.

I'm not a genius, I'm just dedicated, it's different.  Don't expect me to understand whatever convoluted thing you want to add or fix, unless you have notes/video explaining things.

I'm likely not going to add your patches unless I know/trust you.
