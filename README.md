# libblockparty
Blockparty multipurpose security library.  This library contains a lot of useful code developed over my career working as a penetration tester.  The vast majority of the code within this library is designed to extend my own capabilities, as well as provide a base of code from which I can develop useful tools or applications.  This library is fairly large, and was developed privately over a long period of time.  This library contains it's own event system, x86-32 disassembler, file format parsers, memory profiler, network bindings, database bindings, and a variety of other useful code.  I had initially designed it with the idea that I would one day sell the code, but since it has become too large for me to manage on my own, I've decided to simply open source it under the MIT license so someone can potentially find use from it.  I will be updating the library periodically.
